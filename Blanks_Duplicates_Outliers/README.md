# Find and Remove Blanks, Duplicates and Outliers
* Microsoft Excel
* Conditional Formatting
* Highlight cell rules
* Data Validation

## Explanation 
* First we want to locate any blank cells within the file. To do this I used the Go to special feature denoted by the magnifying glass icon in the home section. As seen in image 1, all blank cells are greyed out.
* What the blank cells mean can either be information that was mistakenly left blank for an example 'Martin Senior' registration number, where we simply inserted the data. Or it could be an extra row that was added on accident as shown by row 7. Image 2 shows the file without blanks.
* Up next we want to handle any duplicates. To do so we highlight the range of cells and go to the data tab where we see the remove duplicates icon as shown by [ ]. Once we hit 'Ok' all duplicates are removed.
* The last thing we want to correct is the integer values. It wouldn't make sense for a student's grade to be higher than 100 or lower than 0.
