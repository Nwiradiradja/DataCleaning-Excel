# Split Text To Columns
* Using the Text to columns feature
* Ensuring Delimiter is correct

## Explanation 
* First we analyze what columns do we want to split, or what can we split. We are able to split the Name to First and Last name, as well as address to City and country as seen on image 1.
* Second we want to create a new column next to first name where we will put the last name of the person. We highlight the names as seen on image 2 and select the text to columns feature. Once we do that we need to ensure that the delimeter is correct for our situation. In this case our delimeter that seprates the text is a space bar. After applying the changes the two names are split to two columns as seen in image 3.
* Now we follow the same procedure for address however the delimeter in this case is different. The delimeter would be the '-' symbol so we must ensure that the delimter is set to '-' in the setup wizard.
* In the end of this section our result is displayed in image 4.
