# Formatting
* Using TRIM Function
* Using UPPER function
* Clearing format

## Explanation
* Continuing with the process of data cleaning, we want to adjust the format of the file, as seen the names are still formatted non uniformly as well as the address. The grades are all lowercase, let's make them all upper case and the averages are not consistent, some averages are decimals, some are whole numbers
* First thing is first let's clear the format of the data, essentially starting fresh by using the clear formats feature as seen in image 1.
* Starting off with the averages we're going to highlight the column and use the format cells feature then go to numbers. Adjust the decimal places to 0 so all numbers within the column are just whole numbers as seen on image 2.
* Up next let's work with the names, we see for an example JANE DOE is aligned far left and same with Jane Foster. We're going to create a new column next to the name column and use the trim feature as seen by image 3. After hitting enter we're going to drag down so the entire column is filled with the clean data as seen by image 4 and 5. Lastly we copy and paste the clean column to the old column and delete the column we recently created with an end result of image 6.
* Next we want to ensure the case format for the names, JANE DOE is all caps and so is WILL SMITH, we want to enforce uniform formatting. To do this we use the same steps to fix the format which is new column but instead of using trim we will be using the proper function as seen in image 7. After hitting enter, drag down, copy the column to the old column and delete the column that was just created.
* Lastly are the grades, same steps exactly as the case format for the name but instead of proper we will be using UPPER instead as seen by image 8.
* After these steps we get a result of image 9.
